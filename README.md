# Dart-Flutter-Mini-Projects

### Welcome to my Flutter Mini Projects Repository!

Here, you'll find a collection of mini projects I've created to practice Flutter and Dart. These projects serve as my playground for experimenting with different Flutter widgets, layouts, and functionalities. In this repository I have implemented:

- Firebase CRUD: I've integrated Firebase to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on data.

- Expansion Tiles and Panels, Carousel: I've utilized Flutter's Expansion Tiles and Panels, along with a Carousel widget, to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

- SQFLite CRUD: I've used SQFLite, a local SQLite database, to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on local data.

- Video Player: I've incorporated a video player widget to play videos seamlessly within the app.

- Image Uploader (Firebase): I've implemented a feature to upload images to Firebase storage and display them in the app.

- Ping Notification: I've integrated push notifications using ping to keep users informed and engaged.

- Validated Form: I've created forms with validation to ensure accurate user input and a smooth user experience.

- Google Authentication using Firebase: I've enabled Google sign-in authentication using Firebase for easy and secure user logins.

- Shared Preferences: I've used shared preferences to store small amounts of data locally for efficient app state management.

- REST API CRUD: I've performed Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using RESTful APIs to interact with external data sources.
